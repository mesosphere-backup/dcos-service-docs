# Contributor Guidelines

## Getting Started

TODO

## Submitting Changes to ServiceName

- A GitHub pull request is the preferred way of submitting patch sets.

- Any changes in the public API or behavior must be reflected in the project
  documentation.

- Pull requests should include appropriate additions to the unit test suite.

- If the change is a bugfix, then the added tests must fail without the patch
  as a safeguard against future regressions.


## Style

TODO.
